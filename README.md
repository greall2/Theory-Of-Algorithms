# Theory-Of-Algorithms

This repo is part of a C.A. for Theory of Algorithms Module in 4th year Software Development, GMIT.

The C.A. consists of multiple problems to be completed in the racket programming language.

### Racket
Racket formally known at PLT Scheme is a multi-paradigm promgramming language.
Rackets main goal is to serve as a platform for language creation, design and implementation.
Racket is the worlds first ecosystem for developing and deploying new languages

#### Running a racket file without using the DR Racket IDE:
* Create a file in an IDE of your chioce
* Ensure you have '#lang racket' at top top of the file
* Save the file with the extension rkt meaning racket

> Shorthand for creating a list

> #### define
